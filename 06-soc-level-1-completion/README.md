## Overview

I’ve officially completed TryHackMe’s SOC Level 1 Path: a comprehensive training program designed to build practical skills for entry-level Security Operations Center (SOC) roles.

This path included hands-on labs, real-world scenarios, and practical tool usage across key blue team disciplines. Working through this journey solidified my understanding of how SOC analysts detect, investigate, and respond to threats.

- Digital Forensics and Incident Response
- Phishing Investigation
- Splunk Fundamentals
- Capstone Investigation

---
## Key Skills Developed

- Analyzing network traffic using Wireshark, Zeek, TShark, Snort
- Investigating endpoint artifacts with Sysinternals, Sysmon, osquery, and Wazuh
- Performing memory forensics with Volatility and Redline
- Triaging phishing emails and extracting IOCs
- Working with SIEM tools, specifically Splunk, to query logs and visualize data
- Utilizing digital forensics tools like Autopsy, KAPE, and TheHive for case management
- Applying threat intelligence frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK and the Diamond Model to real-world incidents

## Lessons Learned and Reflections

Completing this path has been one of the most valuable parts of my cybersecurity learning journey so far. Each section connected tools and techniques to real-world attacker behavior, and taught me how defenders think beyond just tools and alerts.

The capstone investigation was especially rewarding because it combined everything into a single scenario; linking evidence from logs, memory, network captures, and forensic artifacts to piece together an incident timeline.

This experience confirmed that I want to keep moving deeper into blue team roles and eventually transition from SOC analysis into security engineering and threat detection engineering.
